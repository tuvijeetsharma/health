    <b><p>Personal hygiene is how you care for your body. This practice includes bathing, washing your hands, brushing your teeth, and more.
<br><br>
      Every day, you come into contact with millions of outside germs and viruses. They can linger on your body, and in some cases, they may make you sick. Personal hygiene practices can help you and the people around you prevent illnesses. They can also help you feel good about your appearance.
      <br><br>
      Learn more about why hygiene is so important, the best ways to practice it, and how you can change your habits to make yourself feel and look better.</p></b>

      <h1>Types of personal hygiene</h1>
      <br><br>
      <p>Each person’s idea of personal hygiene differs. These main categories are a useful place to start for building good hygiene habits:</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Toilet hygiene</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Wash your hands after you use the restroom. Scrub with soap for 20 to 30 seconds, and be sure to clean between your fingers, on the back of your hands, and under your nails. Rinse with warm water, and dry with a clean towel.
<br><br>
        If you don’t have running water or soap, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer will also work. Use one that’s at least 60 percent alcohol.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Shower hygiene</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Personal preference may dictate how often you wish to shower, but most people will benefit from a rinse at least every other day. Showering with soap helps rinse away dead skin cells, bacteria, and oils.
<br><br>
          You should also wash your hair at least twice a week. Shampooing your hair and scalp helps remove skin buildup and protects against oily residues that can irritate your skin.</p>
          <br><br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Nail hygiene</h2>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Trim your nails regularly to keep them short and clean. Brush under them with a nail brush or washcloth to rinse away buildup, dirt, and germs.
<br><br>
            Tidying your nails helps you prevent spreading germs into your mouth and other body openings. You should also avoid biting your nails.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Teeth hygiene</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Good dental hygiene is about more than just pearly white teeth. Caring for your teeth and gums is a smart way to prevent gum diseases and cavities.

              Brush at least twice a day for 2 minutes. Aim to brush after you wake up and before bed. If you can, brush after every meal, too. Floss between your teeth daily, and ask your dentist about using an antibacterial mouthwash.
              
              These two steps can help prevent tooth decay and eliminate pockets where bacteria and germs can build up.</p>

              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>Sickness hygiene</h2>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>If you’re not feeling well, you should take steps to keep from spreading germs to others. This includes covering your mouth and nose when sneezing, wiping down shared surfaces with an antibacterial wipe, and not sharing any utensils or electronics. Also, immediately throw away any soiled tissues.</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>Hands hygiene</h2>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>Germs on your hands can easily enter your body through your mouth, nose, eyes, or ears. Wash your hands:
<br><br>
               . when you handle food<br><br>
               . before you eat<br><br>
               . if you handle garbage<br><br>
               . when you sneeze<br><br>
               . any time you touch an animal<br><br>
                Likewise, wash your hands after changing a baby’s diaper, helping someone clean themselves, or when cleaning a cut or wound.</p>
