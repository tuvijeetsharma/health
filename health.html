        <h2>What is health?</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p><b> In simple words we can say"Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."</p></b>

        <h2>Why is health so imp??(and why do we say health is wealth!??)</h2>
        <br>
        <p><i>Health is the biggest wealth. It helps us to enjoy all the little things in life. If one is not healthy, they fail to feel happy. Being unhappy can impact the health of people around us too. In order to be truly healthy, one must eat well, sleep on time and wake up early. Staying fit by exercising daily also helps to keep one’s health in proper check. If you are in good health, you can always work to attain more wealth. But if one is not healthy, then wealth is of no importance. Hence, we should adopt and work towards a healthy lifestyle.
<br><br>
While most definitions of health focus on the fact that how weak or strong one’s body physically is and how immune they are to illnesses and injuries, a new conversation has been stirring about the wellbeing of your mental health. If we go through the pages of human history, the greatest assets identified for all individuals are good health and a sound mind. What is noteworthy is the strong conjunction and interdependence these two variables have on each other.
<br>
One who does not have good mental health fails to maintain good physical strength and stamina. Only a stress-free headspace and the right frame of mind can lead to strong physical health. This combination makes it possible for us to see and feel the true eternal happiness which is intrinsic and arises from within. The endless and tiring pursuit of happiness often makes one forget that they also have to take care of their physical as well as mental health.

<br>
 
As kids, we’re often told that maintaining a good lifestyle can lead to the best of health. But only as we grow older, do we realise that introspection, self-realisation and reflection of one’s own thoughts is also a crucial aspect of maintaining good mental health which perhaps leads to a fit and fine body. The lack of this approach often leads to this gloomy thought process at times, where one fails to understand what is troubling them and what particularly are they lacking. Maintaining good health hence becomes vital for the overall core development of our personality and perspective towards life.
