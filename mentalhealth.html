        <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Mental health in simple wordscan be defined as a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community</p>
        <br><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Why is mental health important?</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br><p> Mental health is not just a concept that refers to an individual’s psychological and emotional well being. Rather it’s a state of psychological and emotional well being where an individual is able to use their cognitive and emotional capabilities, meet the ordinary demand and functions in the society. According to WHO, there is no single ‘official’ definition of mental health.
<br><br>
        Thus, there are many factors like cultural differences, competing professional theories, and subjective assessments that affect how mental health is defined. Also, there are many experts that agree that mental illness and mental health are not antonyms. So, in other words, when the recognized mental disorder is absent, it is not necessarily a sign of mental health.

    <h2> What is the current status of mental health services in developing countries?
       </h2>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p> Despite the global advocacy for mental health early in the new millennium and a call for action by the ministries of health following the publication of the 2001 World Health Report , improvements have been inconspicuous, and there remains a wide gap in the provision of services for mental health worldwide. The shortcomings in mental health services, particularly in low-income countries, can be summarized as follows.
        <br><br>
        The treatment gap for serious mental disorders ranges from 76.3% to 85.4% in developing countries and resources are insufficient in this regard . For example, about a third of people with schizophrenia do not receive any treatment in their life.
        Scarcity of resources is evident in different areas: about a third of the countries do not have a mental health policy. Although the majority of countries have legislation on mental health, this has not been updated for 15 years in half of them.
        People with mental disabilities do not even benefit from disability benefits in 45% of low-income countries.
        Only about half of the low-income countries have community mental health services. About a quarter of low-income countries do not even provide essential antidepressant medicines, for example.
        Low-income countries have a median of 0.05 psychiatrists and 0.16 psychiatric nurses per 100 000 populations, while the same figures are about 200 times higher in developed countries.
        In most developing countries there is no specified public budget or there is only a small budget for mental health insurance.
        Not only is access to mental health services limited but service utilization is also quite low , Which is commonly due to lack of awareness about mental illness, attributing it to superstitious causes or due to stigma attached to mental illness which is further intensified by dominance of isolated hospital based interventions instead of integrated services .</p>
