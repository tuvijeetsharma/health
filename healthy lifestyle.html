        <h2>Some of the ways for Maintaining Good Health are as follows:</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
          <p> <b> <u> Eat a balanced and nutrient-rich diet. <br><br>
            Eat small portions at frequent intervals. <br><br>
            Sleep well and meditate.<br><br>
            Avoid junk foods and don’t skip meals.<br><br>
            Include fibers and immunity building foods in your diet.<br><br>
            Stay hydrated.<br><br>
            Be active and exercise daily.</p> </b></u>

         <h1>Some points that you should always keep in mind!!</h1>
        <br><br><p> <b> <i>
            Brush and floss daily to keep your teeth and gums healthy and free of disease. <br><br>

            <br><br>
Get a good night's rest. <br><br>

<br><br> Well-rested people not only cope better with stress, but may also have better control of their appetites. <br><br> Research has shown that a lack of sleep can put our "hunger hormones" out of balance  and possibly trigger overeating. <br><br>
Enjoy regular family meals. <br><br>

<br><br> This allows parents to serve as good role models, can promote more nutritious eating, and sets the stage for lively conversations. <br><br> Being connected to family and/or friends is a powerful aspect of a healthy life.
Smile and laugh out loud several times a day. <br><br> It keeps you grounded, and helps you cope with situations that would otherwise make you crazy. <br><br> Read the comics, watch a sitcom, or tell jokes to bring out those happy feelings. <br><br>

<br><br>
Meditate, pray, or otherwise find solace for at least 10-20 minutes each day. <br><br>

<br><br> Contemplation is good for your soul, helps you cope with the demands of daily life, and may even help lower your blood pressure. <br><br>
Get a pedometer and let it motivate you to walk, walk, walk. Forget about how many minutes of activity you need; just do everything you can to fit more steps into your day. <br><br> No matter how you get it, physical activity can help defuse stress, burn calories, and boost self-esteem. <br><br>
Stand up straight. <br><br><img src="https://us.123rf.com/450wm/dreamcreation01/dreamcreation011605/dreamcreation01160500099/63619393-illustration-of-cute-boy-standing.jpg?ver=6" alt="">
<br><br> You'll look 5 pounds lighter if you stand tall and tighten your abdominal muscles. <br><br> Whenever you walk, think "tall and tight" to get the most out of the movement. <br><br>
Try Yoga! <br></yoga>
<img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/VeeRLDH06QxvWFSLnT/giphy.gif" alt="">  <br><br> The poses help increase strength and flexibility and improve balance. <br><br> These are critical areas for older folks especially, and both men and women can benefit. <br><br>
Power up the protein. <br><br>
<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200xn/p0417ds6.jpg" alt=""> <br><br> This nutrient is an essential part of your eating plan, and can make up anywhere from 10%-35% of your total calories. <br><br> Protein lasts a long time in your belly; combine it with high-fiber foods and you'll feel full on fewer calories. <br><br> Enjoy small portions of nuts, low-fat dairy, beans, lean meat, poultry, or fish. <br><br>
Last but not least, have a positive attitude. <br><br> Do your best to look at life as if "the glass is half full." You must believe in yourself, have good support systems, and think positively ("I think I can, I think I can…") to succeed.
